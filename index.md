<h2>Lifted Trucks</h2>
<p>Lifted trucks are trucks that have been modified to have a higher ground clearance.
Lifted trucks are typically built for off-road purposes, such as driving on rough terrain.
Lifted trucks are also built for show purposes, such as entering a lifted truck into a car show.
Lifted trucks are also built for towing purposes, such as towing a trailer or a boat.
Lifted trucks are also built for hauling purposes, such as hauling a load of dirt or gravel.
